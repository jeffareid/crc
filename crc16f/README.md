Fast non-reflected 16 bit CRC converted from example code from Intel to
work with Visual Studio, with comments added to explain what the RK..
constants represent.

crc16fa.asm - assembly code using pclmulqdq

crc16fc.cpp - code to test crc16fa.asm

crc16fg.cpp - code to generate the RK.. constants used by crc16fa.asm
